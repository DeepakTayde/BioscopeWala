# Getting Started with Create React App
# BioscopeWala Documentation
## Overview
**BioscopeWala** is a web application designed for booking movie tickets. It provides users with an intuitive interface to browse and book tickets for their favorite movies.

## Features
- **Movie Ticket Booking**: Users can search for movies, view showtimes, and book tickets.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration for users.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various devices using Tailwind CSS.
## Front-End
The front-end of BioscopeWala is built using the following technologies:

- **HTML**: Structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: Styling of the web pages.
- **JavaScript**: Interactive elements and functionality.
- **React**: Component-based architecture for building the user interface.
- **Redux**: State management across the application.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
## Back-End
The back-end of BioscopeWala is powered by:

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
## Database
- **MongoDB
This project was bootstrapped with [﻿Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` 
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [﻿http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test` 
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [﻿running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build` 
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [﻿deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject` 
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you **`**eject**`**, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
